# Comparison of Expense Tracker Implementations: C++ vs Python
## Introduction

This report compares two implementations of an Expense Tracker Application—one in C++ and one in Python. Both versions support the same core functions: adding expenses, filtering expenses by date or category, and displaying expense summaries. However, they leverage language-specific features that have different impacts on design, performance, and readability.
- Add expenses with fields: Date, Amount, Category, and Description. 
-  Filter expenses by date range or category. 
-  View total expenses by category and overall. 
-  Compare implementations between Python and C++. 

Both files are analyzed for key metrics that reflect the implementation of the core features (e.g., functions for filtering, summarizing, etc.).

## Key Language-Specific Features

Below is a table comparing three major language-specific features—memory management, data structures, and error handling/verbosity—with code snippets to showcase the differences between the C++ and Python implementations.

| **Feature**                           | **C++ Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Python Implementation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Management**                 | **Approach:** Uses smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) to ensure deterministic memory cleanup.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Approach:** Relies on automatic garbage collection, simplifying the code without manual memory management.                                                                                                                                             |
|                                       | **Code Snippet:** <br> void addExpense(const std::string &date, double amount, const std::string &category, const std::string &description) {<br> expenses.push_back(std::make_unique<Expense>(Expense{date, amount, category, description}));<br>}<br>                                            | **Code Snippet:**<br>def add_expense(date, amount, category, description):<br> expense = {<br> "date": date,<br> "amount": amount,<br> "category": category,<br> "description": description<br> }<br> expenses.append(expense)<br>                       |
| **Data Structures**                   | **Approach:** Defines a `struct Expense` for type safety and uses STL containers (`std::vector` and `std::map`) for efficient storage and retrieval.                                                                                                                                               | **Approach:** Uses dynamic data structures like lists and dictionaries, which reduce boilerplate code and enhance readability.                                                                                                                           |
|                                       | **Code Snippet:**<br>struct Expense {<br> std::string date;<br> double amount;<br> std::string category;<br> std::string description;<br>};<br><br>std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Expense>> expenses;<br>                                                                                             | **Code Snippet:**<br> expenses = []<br><br>def add_expense(date, amount, category, description):<br> expense = {<br> "date": date,<br> "amount": amount,<br> "category": category,<br> "description": description<br> }<br> expenses.append(expense)<br> |
| **Error Handling and Code Verbosity** | **Approach:** C++ requires explicit error handling and type declarations, resulting in more verbose but predictable code.                                                                                                                                                                          | **Approach:** Python’s concise syntax and exception handling allow for faster prototyping and easier maintenance, though with less control.                                                                                                              |
|                                       | **Discussion:** Explicit type checking and manual error handling help catch issues at compile time.                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Discussion:** Dynamic typing and built-in exceptions simplify development at the expense of potentially catching errors later (at runtime).                                                                                                            |
| **Standard Library**                  | **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)** provides powerful data structures and algorithms. Offers high performance but requires understanding of templates and iterators| **Python's standard library** is extensive and provides a wide range of modules for various tasks. Offers a high level of abstraction and ease of use.                                                                                                   |

## Impact on Design, Performance, and Readability

- **Design:**  
  The C++ implementation’s explicit memory management and static type system demand a disciplined design approach, which can result in highly optimized and robust applications. In contrast, Python’s dynamic typing and high-level abstractions allow for rapid development and simpler designs.

- **Performance:**  
  C++ typically outperforms Python in raw execution speed and resource management due to its low-level control and compile-time optimizations. Python, while generally slower, is more than adequate for applications where rapid development and maintainability are prioritized.

- **Readability:**  
  Python’s concise and expressive syntax makes the code more accessible, particularly for those new to programming. C++ code tends to be more verbose, which can improve clarity around resource management but might be more challenging for quick prototyping.

## Features Walkthrough (C++ Implementation)

Let’s start with the **C++ implementation** of the Expense Tracker. The C++ version is a simple console program written in modern C++ (using C++14). It uses a `struct Expense` to define the data for each expense entry (including fields for date, amount, category, and description), ensuring strong **type safety** for each piece of data. All expense entries are stored in a `std::vector` container, but instead of storing raw structures, we use **smart pointers** (`std::unique_ptr<Expense>`) to manage memory. This means each new expense is allocated dynamically, and the unique pointer automatically frees that memory when it’s no longer needed, preventing memory leaks without us manually deleting objects. This showcases how C++ handles **memory management** deterministically and safely.

**Adding Expenses:** The application includes a function `addExpense(date, amount, category, description)` which creates a new `Expense` and pushes it into the vector. For example, in our code we add a few sample expenses like a `$50.00` food expense on `2023-10-10` (Lunch at a restaurant), a `$30.00` transport expense on `2023-10-15` (Bus fare), and a `$20.00` food expense on `2023-10-20` (Snacks). Each call to `addExpense` uses `std::make_unique` to create a new `Expense` object and store it in the vector. Because C++ is statically typed, the structure of each expense is fixed and we catch any type mismatches at compile time (for instance, the amount must be a numeric `double`, the date and category are `std::string`, etc.).

**Filtering Expenses:** We implemented two filtering functions in C++. One is `filterExpensesByCategory(category)` which iterates through the vector and prints out any expenses that match the given category. We use a simple loop to check each expense’s `category` field and format the output in a neat table with columns (Date, Amount, Category, Description). To make the console output easy to read, the code uses `<iomanip>` features like `std::setw` (to align columns) and prefixes the amount with a `$` sign. If no expenses are found for the category, it prints a message indicating that. The second function is `filterExpensesByDate(startDate, endDate)`, which goes through the list and finds expenses whose date falls between the start and end dates (inclusive). In C++, we kept dates as strings in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, so comparing those strings works as a simplistic way to check the date range (since lexicographically, “2023-10-10” to “2023-10-15” will catch dates in that interval). In a more advanced scenario, we could parse dates into a date object, but for this simple project, string comparison is sufficient given the consistent format.

**Displaying Summary:** Another feature of the C++ tracker is the `showSummary()` function. This function calculates the total expense amount per category and an overall total. It uses a `std::map` (associative container) to accumulate sums for each category. As it iterates through all expenses, it adds up amounts for each category (for example, all “Food” expenses summed together, all “Transport” expenses summed, etc.) and also keeps a running total of all expenses. Finally, it prints out the summary in a clear format, e.g., it might show “Food: $70.00”, “Transport: $30.00”, and “Total Expenses: $100.00” based on our sample data. We use `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision(2)` to format these totals to two decimal places, making it look like a proper financial report. This part of the code demonstrates how C++ requires a bit more code and careful formatting to produce output, but it gives us fine-grained control over how data is presented.

## Features Walkthrough (Python Implementation)

Now, let’s look at the **Python implementation** of the Expense Tracker. The Python version is also a console program and it provides the same functionality: adding expenses, filtering by category or date, and displaying a summary. However, the approach in Python is quite different due to the language’s dynamic nature and built-in high-level data types. In Python, we do not need to define a strict structure for an expense. Instead of a struct, we simply use a **dictionary** (`dict`) to represent each expense (with keys like "date", "amount", "category", "description"). All expenses are stored in a Python **list** (which is analogous to the vector, but dynamic in size and typed dynamically). This means we can append any dict object to the list without pre-declaring its type, showcasing Python’s **dynamic typing** and flexibility in data structures.

**Adding Expenses:** In the Python code, there is a function `add_expense(date, amount, category, description)`. This function attempts to parse the `date` string into a Python `datetime` object using Python’s built-in `datetime.strptime` method. If the date string is not in the expected format (`YYYY-MM-DD`), the function prints an error message (demonstrating simple error handling in Python with try/except). If the date is valid, it creates a dictionary for the expense (for example: `{"date": datetime_object, "amount": 50.0, "category": "Food", "description": "Lunch at a restaurant"}`) and appends it to the global `expenses` list. Notice that we convert the amount to a float as well. We don’t have to worry about memory allocation for this object – Python’s **garbage collector** will handle memory cleanup automatically when objects are no longer in use. This makes the code simpler (we just create and use objects), but we rely on Python’s runtime for memory management.

**Filtering Expenses:** The Python implementation provides two analogous functions: `filter_expenses_by_category(category)` and `filter_expenses_by_date(start_date, end_date)`. Thanks to Python’s concise syntax, these are implemented in just a line or two using **list comprehensions**. For example, `filter_expenses_by_category` goes through the list and returns a new list of expense dictionaries where the `category` (lowercased) matches the target category. The date filtering function converts the input start and end date strings to `datetime` objects and then filters the expenses list for any entry whose `date` falls within the range. If the date strings are invalid, it prints an error (again showing Python’s easy error handling with exceptions) and returns an empty list. The use of Python’s `datetime` objects here means we can compare dates properly (as dates rather than strings), which is a nice built-in feature that made this filtering straightforward. The code is very compact – what takes several lines of loop and condition in C++ is achieved with a one-liner in Python.

After getting the filtered results, we have a helper function `print_expenses(expense_list, title)` in the Python code that neatly prints a list of expense entries with a given title (e.g., “Filtered by Category (Food):”). This function handles formatting the output in columns (Date, Amount, Category, Description) using f-string formatting and string alignment operations. For instance, it uses `f"{exp['date'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d'):<12}"` to left-align the date in a 12-character width column, and similarly formats the amount with two decimal places. This results in an output table very similar to the C++ version’s output, but the code to produce it is shorter, leveraging Python’s high-level string formatting capabilities.

**Displaying Summary:** In Python, the summary of expenses is produced by the `show_summary()` function. This works in a similar way to the C++ version: it iterates through the list of expenses and accumulates totals per category and an overall total. Instead of a C++ map, we use a Python dictionary (`category_totals`) where each key is a category name and the value is the sum of amounts for that category. As we loop, we do things like `category_totals[category] = category_totals.get(category, 0) + amount` to add up amounts. Finally, it prints each category total and the overall total, formatting the numbers to two decimal places. The output might look like: 
```
Expense Summary:
Food: $70.00  
Transport: $30.00  
Total Expenses: $100.00
``` 
which, as you can see, matches the C++ output in content. The difference is mostly behind the scenes in how the code is written: Python lets us write this functionality with fewer lines (no need for explicit iterators or type definitions) and with automatic memory management.

## Conclusion

Both the C++ and Python implementations of the Expense Tracker meet the core functional requirements, yet each language’s unique features influence the application in different ways. The C++ version benefits from tight control over memory and high performance, while the Python version excels in readability and rapid development. This comparative study underscores the trade-offs inherent in choosing one language over another and demonstrates that both approaches can successfully implement the same core functionality with distinct advantages. 

C++ and Python offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of design, performance, and readability. C++ excels in performance-critical applications with its fine-grained control and static typing. However, it requires careful memory management and can lead to complex code. Python prioritizes ease of use and rapid development with automatic memory management and a rich standard library. While it may have performance limitations, its concise syntax and readability make it suitable for a wide range of applications.
