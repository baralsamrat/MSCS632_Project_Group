# Demonstration of Expense Tracker Implementations

## Introduction

This report demonstration two implementations of an Expense Tracker Application—one in C++ and one in Python. Both versions support the same core functions: adding expenses, filtering expenses by date or category, and displaying expense summaries. However, they leverage language-specific features that have different impacts on design, performance, and readability.

- Add expenses with fields: Date, Amount, Category, and Description.
- Filter expenses by date range or category.
- View total expenses by category and overall.
- Compare implementations between Python and C++.

Both the C++ and Python implementations of the Expense Tracker meet the core functional requirements, yet each language’s unique features influence the application in different ways. The C++ version benefits from tight control over memory and high performance, while the Python version excels in readability and rapid development. This comparative study underscores the trade-offs inherent in choosing one language over another and demonstrates that both approaches can successfully implement the same core functionality with distinct advantages.

C++ and Python offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of design, performance, and readability. C++ excels in performance-critical applications with its fine-grained control and static typing. However, it requires careful memory management and can lead to complex code. Python prioritizes ease of use and rapid development with automatic memory management and a rich standard library. While it may have performance limitations, its concise syntax and readability make it suitable for a wide range of applications.
