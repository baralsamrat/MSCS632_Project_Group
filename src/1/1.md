In this deliverable, you will implement a basic shell that:

- Your applications should perform the same core functions, leveraging the unique features of each assigned language.
- Your code must demonstrate the specified language-specific features.
- All code should be stored in a collaborative GitHub repository for easy access and version control.

## Expense Tracker Application

This repository contains an Expense Tracker Application implemented in Python and C++, demonstrating how different programming languages handle data structures, memory management, and error handling.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to:

- Add expenses with fields: Date, Amount, Category, and Description.
- Filter expenses by date range or category.
- View total expenses by category and overall.
- Compare implementations between Python and C++.

## Comparison

### Metrics

If you want to go further, you can also analyze code metrics like:

- **Lines of Code (LOC):** Compare the number of lines in each implementation.
- **Number of Functions/Methods:** How many functions each implementation has.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Use static analysis tools to measure the complexity of the code.

These metrics can be generated using code analysis tools (like `cloc` for LOC or specific static analyzers for complexity) and can be presented in graphical charts if desired. the two implementations with effective method is to create a table that highlights how each language meets the core requirements and leverages its language-specific features.

| **Requirement**                | **C++ Implementation**                                                                                                        | **Python Implementation**                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**               | Uses a `struct Expense` with fields for date, amount, category, and description; stored in a `std::vector` of smart pointers. | Likely uses dictionaries (or classes) and lists to store expense entries with keys such as date, amount, category, and description. (See README for description.) |
| **Filtering Functionality**    | Provides functions like `filterExpensesByCategory` and `filterExpensesByDate` to filter expenses by category and date range.  | Implements similar filtering logic, probably utilizing Python’s dynamic typing and concise list comprehensions or loops.                                          |
| **Summary Function**           | The `showSummary` function uses a `std::map` to aggregate expenses by category and calculate the overall total.               | Uses Python’s dictionaries to accumulate totals per category and calculates overall expenses.                                                                     |
| **Language-Specific Features** | Demonstrates explicit memory management via `std::unique_ptr` and uses STL containers (vector, map).                          | Showcases dynamic typing, likely leverages Python’s `datetime` module for date handling, and simpler data structures.                                             |
